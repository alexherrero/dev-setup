# Plan: One-shot Mac dev-machine setup

**Status:** in-progress
**Created:** 2026-04-22
**Brief:** Build a single-command bootstrap for a fresh Mac that reproduces the current dev environment — Antigravity, Gemini Desktop, Claude Desktop, Claude Code CLI, antigravity CLI, gemini CLI, the supporting Homebrew CLIs, and the literal config files captured from this machine (especially `~/.claude/settings.json` with its ~170/121 allow/ask permissions). Windows support is stubbed for a later pass using a reference VM.

## Goal

On a fresh Mac, `./setup.sh` leaves the user with every preferred AI tool installed, every config file in place, and a clear prompt to complete interactive auth steps (Claude login, gh auth, Gemini oauth, Antigravity sign-in). Re-running the script is safe and idempotent. Configs live as literal files in this repo under `configs/` so edits are tracked in git and portable.

## Constraints

- Literal config files in the repo (not templated). No secret-stripping via templating — we strip secrets at capture time and keep the repo public-safe.
- Claude Code CLI installed via Anthropic's official curl installer (not npm), to match the current machine.
- GUI apps (Antigravity, Gemini Desktop, Claude Desktop) pulled from official installer URLs; we do not rehost binaries.
- Secrets (oauth tokens, GitHub tokens, API keys) never enter the repo. Fresh machines re-authenticate.
- Mac-first. Windows gets skeleton files + a README note; real Windows implementation deferred to a later plan.
- Every script must be idempotent — safe to re-run without clobbering or re-prompting.

## Out of scope

- Windows implementation beyond stubs (deferred — intentional, revisit with reference VM).
- SSH key generation and GitHub key upload.
- Version managers (nvm, fnm, asdf, pyenv).
- Additional tooling the current machine doesn't have (Docker, VS Code, Cursor, tmux, fzf, starship, zoxide).
- Secret management / keychain integration.
- A dotfile manager (chezmoi, yadm) — plain copy/symlink is sufficient.
- Restoring `~/.claude.json` state (projects, caches, oauth) — each machine regenerates it.

## Tasks

### 1. Scaffold the setup-scripts layout
- **What:** Create the directory layout and empty entry points: `configs/` (captured app configs), `scripts/` (per-concern install scripts — brew, claude-cli, gui-apps, link-configs, auth-checklist), `setup.sh` (top-level orchestrator, stub only), and a `README.md` describing usage.
- **Verification:** `bash setup.sh --help` exits 0 and prints a usage banner listing the stages. `tree -L 2 .` shows `configs/`, `scripts/`, `setup.sh`, `README.md`. `.harness/verify.sh setup.sh` passes.
- **Status:** [x]

### 2. Capture current machine configs into `configs/`
- **What:** Copy the literal config files from the current machine into the repo under `configs/`, stripping secrets. Targets: `configs/claude/settings.json`, `configs/claude/CLAUDE.md`, `configs/claude-desktop/claude_desktop_config.json`, `configs/gemini/settings.json`, `configs/antigravity/argv.json`, `configs/zsh/.zshrc-additions` (PATH exports only, not a full shell replacement), `configs/git/.gitconfig` (user.name + user.email only). Write a small `scripts/capture.sh` that can re-run this capture so the repo stays in sync as configs evolve.
- **Verification:** Every file under `configs/` parses (`jq empty` on JSON, `bash -n` on `.zshrc-additions`). A grep for `(oauth|refresh_token|access_token|api[_-]?key|bearer)` under `configs/` returns only documented false positives (the literal `"oauth-personal"` auth-mode selector in Gemini settings, and permission-rule strings like `Bash(gh secret set:*)` in Claude settings — all semantically safe, no tokens or keys). `scripts/capture.sh` is idempotent — running twice produces no git diff.
- **Status:** [x]

### 3. Write the Homebrew install script
- **What:** `scripts/install-brew.sh` — installs Homebrew if missing (official `install.sh` URL), then `brew install` the formulae we use: `node`, `gh`, `jq`, `ripgrep`, `shellcheck`, `shfmt`. No casks (Antigravity/Gemini/Claude aren't brewed). Note: `gemini` is an npm global, not a brew formula — it installs in task 4.
- **Verification:** Running twice does not reinstall. After running, `brew list` contains every required formula; `node`, `gh`, `jq`, `rg`, `shellcheck`, `shfmt` are on PATH.
- **Status:** [x]

### 4. Write the CLI-install script (Claude Code CLI + gemini-cli)
- **What:** `scripts/install-clis.sh` — installs both non-brew CLIs. Runs Anthropic's official curl installer for Claude Code (lands at `~/.local/bin/claude`), then `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli` for the Gemini CLI (requires node from task 3). Ensures `~/.local/bin` is on PATH for future shells (idempotent append to `~/.zshrc`).
- **Verification:** After running, `command -v claude` resolves and `claude --version` exits 0; `command -v gemini` resolves and `gemini --version` exits 0. Running twice makes no changes (npm reports "already up to date" or equivalent; curl installer is re-entrant).
- **Status:** [ ]

### 5. Write the GUI-apps install script
- **What:** `scripts/install-gui-apps.sh` — downloads the official DMG/installer for Antigravity, Gemini Desktop, and Claude Desktop; mounts, copies to `/Applications`, unmounts, removes quarantine xattr. Skip-if-exists for each app. Installer URLs live in a top-of-file table so they're easy to update when versions change.
- **Verification:** After running on a machine without the apps, `/Applications/Antigravity.app`, `/Applications/Gemini.app`, `/Applications/Claude.app` all exist and are launchable (`open -na <App>` succeeds). Re-run on an installed machine makes no network calls for apps already present.
- **Status:** [ ]

### 6. Write the config-link script
- **What:** `scripts/link-configs.sh` — places the captured configs at their real OS locations. Prefer symlinks back into the repo so edits on either side stay in sync (`~/.claude/settings.json` → `$REPO/configs/claude/settings.json`). For tools known to rewrite their file in place (TBD — investigate Claude Code's behavior during `/work`), fall back to copy with a content-hash guard. Back up any pre-existing file to `~/.dev-machine-setup-backup/<timestamp>/` before linking.
- **Verification:** After running, `readlink ~/.claude/settings.json` points into the repo (or the file is a byte-exact copy with hash logged). Running twice does not re-backup. `jq empty` passes on every linked JSON file.
- **Status:** [ ]

### 7. Wire the top-level orchestrator
- **What:** Flesh out `setup.sh` to run stages 3–6 in order, with flags `--dry-run` (print the ordered steps), `--skip-apps` (useful in CI / headless), `--only <stage>` (run one stage). Each stage logs a `==> <name>` banner matching harness convention, returns non-zero on failure, and the orchestrator halts on the first failure.
- **Verification:** `./setup.sh --dry-run` prints the ordered stage list and exits 0. `./setup.sh --only brew` runs only the brew stage. On a fresh Mac (or VM snapshot) `./setup.sh` completes all stages and ends with exit 0; re-running produces no meaningful changes.
- **Status:** [ ]

### 8. Post-setup auth checklist
- **What:** `scripts/auth-checklist.sh` — printed at the end of `setup.sh`, enumerates the manual steps that can't be automated: `claude login`, `gh auth login`, `gemini` (first run triggers oauth), open Antigravity.app for sign-in, open Claude.app for sign-in. Include a `docs/first-run.md` covering the same material for reference.
- **Verification:** `scripts/auth-checklist.sh` exits 0 and prints at least the five items above. `docs/first-run.md` exists and every listed command is one the preceding install stages actually provisioned.
- **Status:** [ ]

### 9. Windows stubs
- **What:** `setup.ps1` and `scripts/install-*.ps1` skeletons with the same stage banners but bodies that print `TODO: implement on Windows reference VM` and exit 0. A `docs/windows.md` note describing the deferral. Ensures the repo's contract is cross-platform even if Mac is the only live implementation today.
- **Verification:** Every `.ps1` parses under PowerShell AST (`.harness/verify.sh` handles this if `pwsh` is installed — otherwise confirmed later on the VM). `setup.ps1 --help` / equivalent prints the same stage list. `docs/windows.md` exists.
- **Status:** [ ]

## Risks / open questions

- **Installer URLs for Antigravity + Gemini Desktop may not be stable.** Google doesn't publish permanent direct-download URLs for either. If the URL breaks, task 5 fails and we either pin a version, scrape the download page, or fall back to a manual-install prompt. Mitigation: centralize URLs in a single table file so one-line fixes are cheap.
- **Claude Code may rewrite `~/.claude/settings.json` in place.** If it does, a symlink into the repo could cause inode churn or unintended commits. Task 6 must probe this behavior and choose symlink-vs-copy accordingly; falling back to copy-with-diff-detect is acceptable.
- **Gatekeeper quarantine on downloaded DMGs** will block first-launch. Task 5 handles this with `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine`, which requires the user to confirm once if the DMG is notarized unusually.

## Verification strategy

- `.harness/verify.sh` runs per-file on every `Write|Edit` (bash `-n` + shellcheck if present, pwsh AST parse, `jq empty` on JSON).
- Each task's own verification command (see above) is the primary gate before marking status `[x]`.
- `/review` produces the final deterministic pass (clean tree, all verification commands pass, no TODOs outside the Windows stubs).
- Manual: run the completed `./setup.sh` against a snapshot Mac VM (or a wiped user account) and confirm the resulting state matches the reference machine. This is a `/release`-gate, not per-task.
