#!/usr/bin/env bash
# verify.sh — per-project verification hook.
# Called by the Claude Code PostToolUse hook after every Write|Edit with the
# path of the file that was just written or edited as $1.
#
# development-setup is a shell-and-config repo, so we lint the file types we
# actually edit: shell, PowerShell, and JSON. Each check is single-file and
# fast. Optional linters (shellcheck, pwsh) are used when present and
# silently skipped when not — verify.sh must not fail just because a dev
# hasn't installed the optional tool yet.
#
# RULES:
# - This runs on EVERY Write/Edit. Keep it FAST (<2s total).
# - Prefer single-file operations.
# - Exit 0 on success (silent), non-zero on failure.
