2026-04-22 23:07 /plan — created plan "One-shot Mac dev-machine setup" with 9 tasks
2026-04-22 23:25 /work — completed task 1: "Scaffold the setup-scripts layout" (4 files, 0 tests added)
2026-04-22 23:31 /work — completed task 2: "Capture current machine configs into configs/" (8 files, 0 tests added)
2026-04-23 06:48 /work — completed task 3: "Write the Homebrew install script" (4 files, 0 tests added)
2026-04-23 07:03 /work — completed task 4: "Write the CLI-install script" (3 files, 0 tests added)
2026-04-24 01:55 /work — completed task 5: "Write the GUI-apps install script" (1 file, 0 tests added) — browser-assisted (direct-URL curl infeasible: CF JS challenge on Claude, no canonical URL for Antigravity/Gemini)
2026-04-24 02:07 /work — completed task 6: "Write the config-link script" (1 file, 0 tests added) — confirmed Claude Code + Claude Desktop rewrite their JSONs in place; used copy-if-absent for all app-owned JSON, symlink for CLAUDE.md only, append-with-marker for zshrc, git config --global merge for user info. Backup under ~/.dev-machine-setup-backup/<utc>/, lazy-created.
2026-04-24 02:20 /work — completed task 7: "Wire the top-level orchestrator" (1 file, 0 tests added) — setup.sh with --dry-run / --skip-apps / --only <stage> / --help; missing stage scripts warn+skip (supports in-progress plan); all flag paths verified including real --only link-configs run. First commit using conventional-commit `feat:` prefix per ship-release skill classification rules (calibration noted earlier in session).
2026-04-24 02:30 /work — completed task 8: "Post-setup auth checklist" (2 files, 0 tests added) — scripts/auth-checklist.sh prints the 5 manual steps; docs/first-run.md documents each with provisioning-source references. Orchestrator now finds the script (no longer warn-skipped).
2026-04-24 02:45 /work — completed task 9: "Windows stubs" (7 files, 0 tests added) — setup.ps1 mirrors setup.sh shape (same stages, same flags); five per-stage .ps1 stubs print banner + TODO + exit 0; docs/windows.md covers deferral rationale + per-stage remaining-work table. verify.sh no-ops cleanly on .ps1 without pwsh (AST check deferred to Windows reference VM). All 9 PLAN tasks now complete.

## /plan — feat-debian-cli-support — 2026-04-27
- Drafted 8-task plan for Debian CLI-only support in .harness/PLAN.md
- features.json: appended feat-debian-cli-support (passes: false)
- Open question 1: include Codex CLI? (recommend yes)
- Next: /work after open questions resolved

## /work — feat-debian-cli-support task 1 — 2026-04-27
- scripts/lib/os.sh: OS detection helper (macos|debian|exit 2). External $OS override path validates against allowed values.
- setup.sh: sources os.sh, builds per-OS STAGE_* arrays. Mac: 6 stages unchanged. Debian: 5 stages (apt instead of brew, no gui-apps).
- Verified: shellcheck clean; Mac auto-detect works; OS=debian forced works; OS=plan9 exits 2; --only validates per-OS list.

## /work — feat-debian-cli-support task 2 — 2026-04-27
- scripts/install-apt.sh: NodeSource (node 22 LTS) + GitHub CLI apt repos with explicit keyrings, apt-installs nodejs/gh/jq/ripgrep/shellcheck/shfmt, shfmt fallback to GitHub release binary on older distros (Debian 11, Ubuntu 22.04).
- Idempotent: keyring + sources.list writes guarded by file-exists checks. Defensive Mac guard exits 2 before any sudo if OS != debian.
- Verified: shellcheck -x clean, bash -n clean, Mac guard fires correctly, setup.sh dispatch resolves install-apt.sh as the apt stage on Debian. Runtime VM verification deferred to /release.

## /work — feat-debian-cli-support task 3 — 2026-04-27
- scripts/install-clis.sh: cross-platform (sources os.sh), per-OS rc_file() picker, Debian npm-prefix at ~/.npm-global, Node ≥ 20 guard on Debian, Codex CLI added as third install (@openai/codex).
- Live run on Mac: claude 2.1.112 + gemini 0.39.1 + codex 0.125.0 (new). Idempotent re-run preserves PATH markers.
- Verified: shellcheck -x clean; rc_file() correct on debian/zsh, debian/bash, mac; harness verify.sh ok.

## /work — feat-debian-cli-support task 3 amendment — 2026-04-27
- Codex re-scoped from always-installed to opt-in via --with-codex flag (WITH_CODEX=1).
- setup.sh: --with-codex flag added; exports WITH_CODEX to env. install-clis.sh: Codex install + post-check entry both gated.
- Codex uninstalled from this Mac. Default run skips Codex with informative banner; post-check verifies only claude+gemini.
- Tasks 5 (verify-install) and 6 (auth-checklist) updated to honor the same flag conditionally.

## /work — feat-debian-cli-support task 4 — 2026-04-27
- scripts/lib/os.sh: rc_file() helper centralized (moved from install-clis.sh).
- scripts/install-clis.sh: uses shared rc_file() instead of local copy.
- scripts/link-configs.sh: sources os.sh; Claude Desktop block gated on OS==macos; append_zshrc_additions renamed to append_shell_additions and routes via rc_file(); post-check JSON list excludes ~/Library/... on Debian.
- Verified: Mac re-run no-op; OS=debian forced run skips Mac-only path correctly and validates 3 JSONs; rc_file() correct across debian/zsh, debian/bash, macos.

## /work — feat-debian-cli-support task 5 — 2026-04-28
- scripts/verify-install.sh: sources os.sh; brew Mac-only; GUI-apps + Library JSON consolidated to one OS==macos block (single SKIP on Debian); codex PATH+version conditional on WITH_CODEX (SKIP with hint when off); check_rc_marker replaces check_zshrc_marker via shared rc_file().
- Verified: Mac default 30 ok / 0 warn (baseline preserved); Mac WITH_CODEX=1 30 ok / 1 warn (correct — codex not installed since task 3 amendment); OS=debian forced 25 ok / 0 warn (lost: brew + 3 apps + Library JSON = 5 entries).

## /work — feat-debian-cli-support task 6 — 2026-04-28
- scripts/auth-checklist.sh: sources os.sh; dynamic steps array; codex login conditional on WITH_CODEX=1; GUI sign-ins Mac-only; OS-specific heading text.
- docs/first-run.md: rewritten with ## Mac (5/6 steps) and ## Debian / Ubuntu (3/4 steps) subsections; optional codex documented in both; trailing "What setup.sh leaves behind" updated for platform-specific paths.
- Verified: 4 configurations all correct (Mac default 5 items, Mac+codex 6, Debian 3, Debian+codex 4). Linux output has no Antigravity/Claude Desktop refs. Codex first-run verified as `codex login` via npx.

## /work — feat-debian-cli-support task 7 — 2026-04-28
- README.md: intro reframed for Mac/Debian/Windows; new ### Debian / Ubuntu Usage subsection with --with-codex documented; expanded Layout per-script tree; Status section gets Debian-ready row.
- docs/debian.md: new (~6.3 KB) — quick-start, supported-distros matrix (Debian 11/12/13 + Ubuntu 20.04/22.04/24.04), Antigravity-GUI-only callout citing official docs, toolchain detail, future-work.
- Verified: README has 3 platform subsections; all 5 internal links from README resolve; all 5 internal links from docs/debian.md resolve; Antigravity-not-supported callout grep-matches.

## /work — feat-debian-cli-support task 8 — 2026-04-28 (CLOSE-OUT)
- features.json: valid (jq empty), feat-debian-cli-support entry well-formed, passes:false (per plan — flips at /release-gate after Debian VM exercise).
- All 8 tasks marked [x] in PLAN.md; plan-level Status: "complete pending VM verification".
- documenter sub-agent dispatched: 1 new wiki page (Bootstrap-A-New-Debian-Or-Ubuntu) + 4 edits (Bootstrap-A-New-Mac flipped pending->implemented, Dev-Machine-Setup-Design rewritten for cross-platform OS-dispatch architecture, Home + _Sidebar index updates).
- 9 flat-namespace wiki links all resolve to .md files. Antigravity-GUI-only callout grep-matches in two wiki pages.
- Remaining work for /release: Debian VM run; flip features.passes=true; final v1.0.0 release.

## /plan — feat-ci-verification — 2026-04-28
- 3-task plan written to .harness/PLAN.md.
- features.json: appended feat-ci-verification (passes:false).
- Scope: workflow_dispatch only, no push/PR/cron triggers; macos-latest + ubuntu-latest full pipeline; windows-latest smoke-only (real Windows = next plan); cancel-in-progress concurrency.
- Next: /work task 1 (write the workflow file).

## /work — feat-ci-verification task 1 — 2026-04-28
- .github/workflows/ci-tests.yml: workflow_dispatch only, cancel-in-progress concurrency, 3 parallel jobs (macos-test, ubuntu-test, windows-test).
- Mac job (macos-latest): --help/--dry-run smoke, end-to-end --skip-apps, verify-install 0-warn assertion (with SKIP_APPS=1), idempotency check, --with-codex variant.
- Ubuntu job (ubuntu-latest): same shape + apt path + negative test for ~/Library/... not created on Linux.
- Windows job (windows-latest): smoke only — orchestrator runs cleanly + AST-parse all .ps1 files.
- Scope expansion: SKIP_APPS env-var support added to setup.sh + verify-install.sh (~10 lines) so Mac --skip-apps reports 0 warns. Mirrors WITH_CODEX pattern. Mac default still 30 ok / 0 warn.
- Verified: actionlint clean; structural YAML correct; SKIP_APPS gating works locally.

## /work — feat-ci-verification task 2 — 2026-04-28
- README.md: GH Actions CI badge added (linked to actions/workflows/ci-tests.yml); new ## Testing section explains manual workflow dispatch flow + cancel-in-progress concurrency.
- docs/debian.md: Future work section rewritten — Reference Debian VM entry replaced by CI-verification pointer at .github/workflows/ci-tests.yml; new "Other Ubuntu / Debian releases" entry flags the shfmt-fallback CI gap.
- "Update prior feat-debian-cli-support plan section" sub-step was a no-op — prior plan was overwritten; equivalent state lives in features.json + CHANGELOG.
- Verified: 6 README + 6 docs/debian.md internal links resolve; anchor target exists.

## /work — feat-ci-verification task 1 follow-up — 2026-04-28 (CI fixes)
- install-apt.sh: install_keyring gains armored=0|1 param; NodeSource key piped through gpg --dearmor (root cause: NO_PUBKEY error in CI run 25087325478).
- link-configs.sh: new ensure_claude_co_authored_by_disabled() merges includeCoAuthoredBy=false into ~/.claude/settings.json post-copy. Fixes Mac CI false-warn on fresh runners where Claude installer creates a default settings.json before our seed runs.
- Verified: merge path adds key when missing; idempotent path skips when already set; Mac SKIP_APPS=1 verify-install reports 26 ok / 0 warn.

## /work — feat-ci-verification task 3 — 2026-04-29 (CLOSE-OUT)
- First three-platform green CI dispatch (run 25087515129): macOS 1m34s + Ubuntu 1m20s + Windows 0m25s all success.
- Required two CI-fix iterations (NodeSource dearmor, Claude kill-switch merge) committed in d67affb.
- features.json: feat-ci-verification.passes and feat-debian-cli-support.passes both flipped to true.
- PLAN.md plan-level Status: complete. All 3 tasks [x].
- Next: ship-release v1.0.0 (explicit version, major bump).

## /plan — feat-windows-cli-support — 2026-04-29
- 9-task plan written to .harness/PLAN.md.
- features.json: appended feat-windows-cli-support (passes:false).
- Scope: Windows = Mac scope (full GUI + CLI). Antigravity + Claude Desktop via winget. Gemini Desktop no first-party app — skipped. Codex skip-with-warn (upstream npm broken). Native Claude installer + winget for everything else. PowerShell-native JSON parsing, no jq on Windows.
- 3 open questions surfaced inline with defaults: (1) Codex skip-with-warn vs GitHub-Release fallback; (2) Claude Code native installer vs winget; (3) Antigravity argv.json path empirical verification.
- Next: confirm open questions then /work task 1.
