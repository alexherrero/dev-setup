# Runs the install stages in order: Homebrew formulae, Claude Code CLI,
# GUI apps (Antigravity / Gemini / Claude Desktop), config linking, and
# the post-setup auth checklist.
#
# Individual stage scripts live in scripts/; captured config files live
# in configs/. See README.md for the full layout.

# This file is currently a stub. Flag handling (--dry-run, --skip-apps,
# --only <stage>) and stage dispatch land in PLAN.md task 7. Today it
# prints usage and exits.

Usage: ./setup.sh [--help]

Bootstrap a fresh Mac dev environment by running each install stage in order.

Stages:
EOF
  for stage in "${STAGES[@]}"; do
    printf '  %s\n' "$stage"
  done
  cat <<'EOF'

Flags (future — not yet implemented, see PLAN.md task 7):
  --dry-run      Print the ordered stage list and exit
  --skip-apps    Skip the gui-apps stage (useful for headless runs)
  --only <name>  Run only the named stage

This script is Mac-first. Windows users: see setup.ps1 (stubbed — PLAN.md task 9).
