# install.sh — one-line bootstrap for dev-machine-setup.
#
# Fetches the latest tagged release from GitHub, extracts the source
# tarball to a temp dir, and exec's setup.sh from there with all
# user-supplied args forwarded. No git prereq on the host.
#
# Usage:
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexherrero/dev-machine-setup/main/install.sh | bash
#   curl -fsSL .../install.sh | bash -s -- --skip-apps --dry-run
#
# Trust model: same as Homebrew's install.sh — the trust boundary is
# GitHub's TLS cert + the repo owner's release-signing discipline. Read
# the script before piping it to bash if you don't trust it. The
# `--inspect-before-run` recipe is in docs/install.md.
